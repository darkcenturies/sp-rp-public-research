// The bits of San Andreas we talk to.
//
// Every address here is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas v1.0 US, and they were
// read out of plugin-sdk (github.com/DK22Pac/plugin-sdk, the -sa fork the
// server owner pointed at) rather than written from memory. Our players run the
// HOODLUM 1.0 build, which the crash logs confirm and which Init() checks for
// before anything is called or patched.
//
// One rule matters more than the rest: CALL the radar functions, never touch
// CRadar::ms_RadarTrace directly. Project Eagle raises the blip limit from the
// stock 175 to 3000 through fastman92's limit adjuster, and the way that works
// is by allocating a bigger array somewhere else and rewriting every reference
// to it. The functions have been patched to use the new array; the old address
// at 0xBA86F0 still exists and is now a lie. Reading it would appear to work
// and would corrupt memory under the adjuster.
