// The crash rule list, and matching a crash against it.
//
// The file format is deliberately CrashInfo's, so that JuniorDjjr's list
// (github.com/JuniorDjjr/CrashInfo, MIT) drops in unmodified and every entry
// the MixMods community has built up over the years keeps working:
//
//     Error: 0x004DD5A3
//     Problem: ...
//     Solution: ...
//
// blank-line separated blocks, one key per line. Their numbered variants
// ("Problem 1:", "Solution 2:") and their prose keys ("About:", "Type:",
// "Mod:", "Backtrace:") are body text and are printed back verbatim.
//
// We add four match keys, because an address on its own cannot identify most
// of what actually crashes Project Eagle:
//
//     Library:  matches "Last library loaded"   discord-rpc.asi, bass.dll
//     File:     matches "Last file loaded"      AUDIO\CONFIG\BANKSLOT.DAT
//     Module:   matches module+offset           bass.dll+0xF6DD
//     Code:     matches the exception code      0xC0000094
//
// Module: is the one that earns its place. Anything crashing inside a
// dynamically loaded module - the Discord plugin, the audio library, a GPU
// driver - has a different address every launch, because the module lands at a
// different base. Across 219 Project Eagle crash logs the Discord case alone
// produced 16 distinct addresses; the offset within the module was the same
// every time. Keying on module+offset survives that, and a plain address
// cannot.
//
// A rule matches when every key it declares matches. More keys matched is a
// better match, so a two-key Project Eagle rule beats a one-key generic
// address rule for the same crash - which is exactly what we want, because
// upstream's entry for 0x004DD5A3 says "missing audio folder, update your
// audio drivers" while for our players it means "you did not install over
// GTA SA 1.0".
